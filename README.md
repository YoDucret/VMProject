# VMProject

The goal of the VMProject is creating a simple (or not, over-enginieering is love) way to emulate machines.

For now, all you need to do is creating a dynamic library that implement the IVM (./include/IVM.hh) interface.

When you launch the program, you meet the Virtual Machine Project Initializer aka the VMPI, also called the VaMPIre. The VaMPIre take a path (an absolute one, that's more tasty) to the dynamic library that implement the IVM interface, load it and start the VM.

## Pro Tips

#### 1- "If it's stupid but it works, then it's not stupid" - the marvelous Internet

3- Make it as funny as possible (see the error messages).  
4- You want to print it ? Then PRINT IT !!!
