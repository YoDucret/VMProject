# VMProject

The goal of the VMProject is creating a simple (or not, over-enginieering is love) way to emulate machines.

For now, all you need to do is creating a dynamic library that implement the IVM (./include/IVM.hh) interface.

When you launch the program, you meet the Virtual Machine Project Initializer aka the VMPI, also called the VaMPIre. The VaMPIre take a path (an absolute one, that's more tasty) to the dynamic library that implement the IVM interface, load it and start the VM.
